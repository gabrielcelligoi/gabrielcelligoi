<h1 align="center">Hi, I`m Gabriel ğŸ‘‹</h1>

I`m a Full-Stack web developer working from Canada. I believe that people can play several roles in their lives. I`ve been a student, a teacher, a son, a dad, an architect, a researcher, a podcaster, and many other Gabriels that I couldn`t list here. What are the roles you play?
